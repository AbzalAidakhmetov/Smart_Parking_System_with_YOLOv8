# Smart Parking System with YOLOv8

Welcome to the main repository of my pet project - the Smart Parking System powered by YOLOv8!

## Project Overview

In today's fast-paced world, finding a parking spot can be a daunting task. This project aims to simplify this process using cutting-edge technology. I've built a Smart Parking System that leverages the power of YOLOv8, real-time car counting, and license plate detection to make parking hassle-free.

## Features

### Real-time Car Counting

This system employs state-of-the-art object detection techniques to provide real-time car counting. With YOLOv8's lightning-fast inference speed, it accurately counts the number of vehicles in a parking area, ensuring you never waste time searching for a spot again.

### Real-time License Plate Detection

I understand the importance of security and convenience. The system integrates real-time license plate detection to ensure a seamless parking experience.

### Future Enhancement: Semantic Segmentation

But wait, there's more! I have exciting plans for the future. I am actively working on implementing semantic segmentation for parking lots. This means you'll be able to see which parking spaces are free at a glance. No more circling around aimlessly; you'll know exactly where to park.

## Step by step guide

To give you a clearer picture of how this Smart Parking System works, here's a simplified guidance:


1. **Camera Feed Input:** The system takes input from cameras strategically placed in the parking area.

2. **YOLOv8 Object Detection:** The YOLOv8 model identifies and counts cars in real-time.

3. **License Plate Detection:** Simultaneously, the system detects license plates and validates access.

4. **Semantic Segmentation (Future Enhancement):** I am currently developing the capability to segment parking lots and identify free spaces.

5. **User Interface (Future Enhancement):** The information is presented in an intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to find available parking spots.

6. **Parking Guidance (Future Enhancement):** Users are guided to available parking spaces, making their experience stress-free.
